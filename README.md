AI-powered onboarding automation for SaaS businesses. When a lead submits a form, the system stores the data, generates a personalized welcome email, sends it automatically and alerts the team. Cuts repetitive work, speeds up replies and keeps the whole workflow running on its own so no leads are missed.

The full automation is built in Zapier and can be viewed here:
